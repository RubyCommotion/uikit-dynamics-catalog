Purpose of UIKit Dynamics Catalog App
==================================

This conversion of UIKit Dynamics Catalog's Objective-C code into RubyMotion source code illustrates a number of uses of UIKit Dynamics, the iOS API that provides physics-related 
capabilities and animations to views and other dynamic items. Each of the 10 view controllers in this project shows a different way to use UIKit Dynamicsâ€”-in many cases, 
combining dynamic behaviors for interesting results.
